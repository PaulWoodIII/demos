Since that discussion, two of the other mods stepped down and in turn, &lt;a href=\"/u/patriche\"&gt;/u/patriche&lt;/a&gt; and I accepted invitations to fill their roles. Aside from learning the ropes for day to day management of the sub, our main focus has been looking through the various discussion threads and and develop a few options for implementation, which brings us to today and this discussion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A common theme in each of the discussion threads was there was  a gap between the mod team&amp;#39;s (past and current) philosophy behind how the community should operate, and the understanding/desire of a (not insignificant) number of people in the community. We felt that part of this was a transparency/communication issue. To remedy this we have created a mission statement of sorts that outlines our philosophy. For those of you who participated in the last few community discussions these statements don&amp;#39;t represent a change in ideas, rather it just sets the baseline ideal of how the sub will be run. Much if this is informed on the founding ideals of reddit as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderation Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"/r/Charleston\"&gt;/r/Charleston&lt;/a&gt; mod team subscribes to the philosophy that their role is to ensure &amp;quot;good order&amp;quot; using moderator tools to enforce the community rules. As an extension of this philosophy, the mod team firmly believes its role &lt;strong&gt;is not&lt;/strong&gt;  to ensure &amp;quot;quality content&amp;quot; beyond these rules; rather, that is the role of the community itself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On occasion the mod team is approached by community members asking to restrict or limit certain types of content for being repetitive, low effort, or of low interest. In other words, content that meets the rules, but that user does not want to see.  The mod team&amp;#39;s stance is that individual users can set their &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/prefs/\"&gt;preferences&lt;/a&gt; of &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t show me submissions after I&amp;#39;ve downvoted them&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t show me comments with a score less than ___&amp;quot; instead. This allows  individuals to remove e content out of their view of &lt;a href=\"/r/Charleston\"&gt;/r/Charleston&lt;/a&gt;, without removing it from the view of other community members who may wish to see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Downvotes also communicate to the submitter whether or not their content is providing value to the community, and in most case influences future submissions. In extreme cases where a submitter consistently ignores downvotes and there is &lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt; community consensus that their content &amp;quot;diminishes the value of the community,&amp;quot; the mod team &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; intervene. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another theme from the various discussion, and something we&amp;#39;ve noticed lately while moderating submissions,  is that &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Charleston/wiki/index#wiki_.2Fr.2Fcharleston_submission_rules\"&gt;the current subreddit rules&lt;/a&gt; are worded more as requests than rules and leave a lot of openings for debate even after the mods make a decision. Internally, we also felt that the rules as written did not give the mod team the mandate to act on content that violated the spirit of the community/rules, but didn&amp;#39;t actually break a particular rule. This goes back to the core tenant that the community should be responsible for ensuring quality content. &lt;strong&gt;To remedy this, we are proposing the following re-working of the rules, and would like your feedback on modifications or additions of the below.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/Charleston\"&gt;/r/Charleston&lt;/a&gt; Community Rules (Draft)&lt;/strong&gt; \n&lt;em&gt;The mods reserve the right to remove content, comments, and users who do not comply with our community rules or that otherwise diminish the value of the community&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rule 0 : All Submissions and Comments must follow &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy\"&gt;Reddit site rules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette/\"&gt;Reddiquette&lt;/a&gt;. The mod team has exceptionally low tolerance for trolling, personal attacks and harassment based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rule 1 : All Submissions should be related to Charleston or the surrounding area. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rule 2 : Buy, Sell, Trade, Job postings and other items better suited for &lt;a href=\"http://charleston.craigslist.org/\"&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt; should not be posted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rule 3 : Self-Promotion as loosely defined in &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion\"&gt;Site wide redditqutte on Self Promotion&lt;/a&gt; is generally frowned upon, both by the mod team and the &lt;a href=\"/r/Charleston\"&gt;/r/Charleston&lt;/a&gt; community.

Rare exceptions may be made, solely at the discretion of the mod team, when the poster is a frequent quality contributor in the community and/or the subject of promotion offers a benefit to the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One area we would especially like feedback is on Rule 3. Take for example &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Charleston/comments/4k8g0x/backpedal_a_documentary_on_our_addiction_to_cars/\"&gt;this submission from last week&lt;/a&gt;. While we felt that the fundraising aspect of the post put it in the bucket of SPAM and the submitter isnt a regular &lt;a href=\"/r/Charleston\"&gt;/r/Charleston&lt;/a&gt; contributor, however the following points put it in a gray area:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project itself is Charleston based  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The topic of the project is a Charleston focused issued, and one that gets frequent discussion here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team doing the project (Lunch and Recess) appears to be Charleston based  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The submitter did not appear to be associated with the project, and is has a longstanding account with activity elsewhere across reddit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we decided to leave it and let the upvotes/downvotes and reports take care of it.  &lt;strong&gt;How would you draw this line, how would you like it to be enforced?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great, but how does this stop the low-effort submissions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n- You, right now, after reading all of that  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The above actions are primarily focused on long term direction of the sub. We felt that if we make our moderation philosophy transparent and get &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; community buy in on the new rules that would give us the mandate needed to act on things we feel are damaging the community (especially the last sentence of from the philosophy, and intro to the rules).  We also believe that defining the moderation philosophy ensures a starting point for future changes and discussions as needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To address the current influx of low effort submissions, we feel that we already have the mandate to act now both from community demand and from trying to work compromise with the individuals involved. Basically the mod team has stated several times that we expect that community \ndownvotes should modify posting behavior; and it has not. We will be implementing a technical measure today to require approval of submissions from individuals receiving a significant number of downvotes for their content.  Our current approach is to approve only a single submission a day at most, and dependent on our assessment of what the community prefers to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this option to work long term, we strongly request that the community refrain from down-voting the user whenever they pop up, especially when they do provide a quality submission or comment. There are few instances where some of the individuals have provided quality input only to be downvoted. Essentially, they will need to earn themselves the good graces of the community again, but the community has to also act in good faith. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mod team will also be continuing to work with these users directly should this measure not have the intended outcome. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any additional comments or suggestions on any of these topics, or on the direction of the sub are welcome.
